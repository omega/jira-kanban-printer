This is a bit longer, and
it even runs over multiple lines, because it contains lots of information. For instance:

* This will need some work!
* To look good

But I can have multiple paragraphs!

Now I wonder what will happen if I put a lot more stuff here? Will it span two pages? Will it look nice? Will it cut it automagically?

I hope so, because I really don't want to handle that

% should have avatar of reporter
% Should have a description

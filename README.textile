h1. JIRA Print Server

We had an urge to start trying KANBAN at the office. We use JIRA for all
issue-tracking, but we wanted a physical board, so we needed a way to print our
cards from JIRA.

The solution was this over-engineered pile of crap, with a massive amounts of
components:

* A Groovy script to plug into JIRA
** This depends on the GroovyRunner plugin for JIRA
* A Mojolicious::Lite web-server to recieve commands from the Groovy script
* A ZeroMQ PUB-SUB from the web service to a PDFifier
** Cause we don't want the webserver to block, waiting for PDF production
* The PDFifier uses LaTeX to produce a PDF of an issue.
** Not only that, it produces two identical pages!
* The PDF gets moved to a queue
* We have an AnyEvent-based daemon watching that directory
** When files are created, it will print using CUPS and remove the PDF

In the misc-directory, two of the examples from the Net::CUPS-distro is included, to
aid in any debugging that might be required

h3. tex/

This is the compiled/unpacked verion of the foils package for tex, which I got inspired to use
from this:
